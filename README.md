Taskrunner is a CLI & GUI application, with the intention of sitting somewhere between cron jobs and Jenkins.

The idea is to have a tool that looks after your repetitive tasks, and stores the output somewhere you can find the output easily.

## Install

You need to have Go and GTK 2 installed before running `go get` on this.

Installing GTK on ubuntu:

    sudo apt install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev
